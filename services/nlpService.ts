// This file is a placeholder for the NLP service.
// Transformers.js models can be large, so they are loaded dynamically.
// This mock simulates the behavior of identifying a feature from a query.

// In a real implementation:
// 1. A pipeline from Transformers.js would be initialized (e.g., zero-shot-classification).
// 2. The user query would be processed to extract a likely feature name.
// 3. Fuse.js would be used as a fallback on the list of all web-features.
